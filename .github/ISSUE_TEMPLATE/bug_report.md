PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY: 

You *MUST* read and complete the checklist below, by placing an x into each [ ] (so that it shows '[x]', NOT '[ x]' or '[x ]'), BEFORE clicking on 'Submit new issue'.

If you are reporting an issue when trying to build PhoenixPE, you *MUST* provide a log, period. Please do not assume that the developer(s) will be able to guess the specifics of your environment, what source image you used, what error messages were displayed, or any of the other critical information that the log provides. In order to investigate a build issue, a log is ALWAYS required. For your convenience a log bundle is automatically generated and saved to the `Logs` folder in your PhoenixPE directory. Please attached this .zip file to your ticket.

Failure to perform these steps, WHICH ARE ONLY THERE TO HELP *YOU*, will result in the issue being dismissed without warning.
